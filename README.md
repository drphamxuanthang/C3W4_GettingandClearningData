Please read the following instructions carefully:

There are 3 files (not including README.md) in this repository:

1. CodeBook.docx: a codebook that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
2. run_analysis.R: the script to process data as required
3. FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above. This file will be upload separatedly.

Thank you
